ORIGINAL STEPS:
1. Place steaks between 2 layers of plastic and pound to a thickness of 1/4 inch
2. Place 2 cups flour in a shallow bowl
3. Stir together baking powder, baking soda 1 teaspoon pepper, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in second shallow bowl
4. Add buttermilk, Tabasco sauce, egg, and garlic; stir to combine
5. Heat shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)
6. Place a wire rack over a sheet of parchment paper
7. While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour to coat; shake off excess
8. Dip into buttermilk batter; lift up so excess batter drips back into the bowl
9. Press in flour again to coat both sides completely
10. Place breaded steak on the wire rack and repeat to bread remaining steaks
11. Fry steaks, in batches if necessary, until evenly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side
12. Remove steaks to a paper towel-lined plate to drain
13. Cover with foil to keep warm while you make the gravy
14. Drain fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid and as much of the solid remnants as possible
15. Return the skillet to medium-low heat; add the reserved oil
16. Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup flour into the oil
17. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy
18. Stir in milk, increase the heat to medium, and bring the gravy to a simmer
19. Cook, stirring often, until thick, 6 to 7 minutes
20. Season with kosher salt and pepper
21. Transfer steaks to a platter and pour gravy over top
